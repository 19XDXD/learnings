Also challenges  motivates me to achieve the task. Hence, I present my self as self focused & meeting dead lines is priority for a given task. 

I present all the skills required here for the project, I would like you to take opportunity to review my knowledge & experience & provide me an opportunity to work & discuss the role in further detail.

I'm very intermeditate at Xamarin IOS level but a quick learner and my implementation skills will not take any learning time to get things done for the job.
