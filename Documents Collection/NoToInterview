Hi xyz,

Thank you for considering me for the position of .Net developer at xyz company. I had the opportunity to research about xyz company prior to sending you my resume. I have read many positive things about your company.

It is with some regret that I must decline your offer for an interview. I accepted a position with another organization about 3 weeks ago as a contract developer for 9 Months. I believe it would be unfair to take up your valuable time when I know I will not be able to accept a position if offered at this stage.
  
Please consider this email as a personal thank you. I appreciate your consideration.
I am positive you will find the right candidate to fill this position. I intend to keep your contact information, and hopefully, I will have the chance to meet you at some point in the future. I wish you all the best in your search efforts.
